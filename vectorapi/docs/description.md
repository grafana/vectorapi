VectorAPI is a service for managing vector collections and performing vector similarity queries using a PostgreSQL vector database with the `pgvector` extension. Utilizes `fastapi` for the HTTP API, `pgvector` and SQLAlchemy for the vector database side and relies on `pytorch` for computing embeddings.
